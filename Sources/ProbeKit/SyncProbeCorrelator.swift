/// Synthesis for the microphone-based sync calibration probe (the
/// mic-measurement tier above the by-ear wizard, dev/notes brief
/// `mic-probe-calibration-brief.md`).
///
/// The probe is an exponential sine sweep: constant amplitude, frequency
/// rising (or falling) exponentially between two band edges. Its virtue for
/// this job is the time–bandwidth product — a one-second sweep concentrates
/// 30–40 dB of processing gain into one correlation peak, so a probe played
/// quietly under real room noise still yields an unambiguous arrival time.
///
/// **The two lanes occupy DISJOINT bands, and that separation is what lets
/// both speakers play at once.** Opposite sweep DIRECTIONS over a shared band
/// are not enough: measured, an up sweep and a down sweep across 500 Hz–10 kHz
/// cross-correlate only ~33 dB down. The recording comes from the Mac's own
/// built-in microphone, so the Mac's own speakers are inches away while the
/// other speaker is across the room — a level imbalance of 23 dB in the live
/// 2026-08-28 capture. The loud lane's leakage then sits ABOVE the quiet
/// lane's true peak, and every measurement is refused for want of confidence
/// while both sweeps are plainly audible. Disjoint bands share no bins at all
/// (measured cross-correlation −134 dB), so the tolerable imbalance stops
/// being a probe property and becomes the room's own noise floor — 53 dB for
/// the distant speaker in that same capture. Keep the GUARD GAP between the
/// two bands when tuning them; abutting edges lose most of the isolation.
///
/// The quiet, distant lane gets the HIGH band: room noise is dominated by
/// low-frequency rumble, and that same capture measured its noise floor 12 dB
/// lower above 3 kHz — worth more than the extra air absorption up there.
///
/// The band edges deliberately stay inside 500 Hz–10 kHz: small speakers roll
/// off below a few hundred Hz, and A2DP codecs commonly roll off above
/// 14–18 kHz, so probe energy parked outside this band would be spent where
/// the physical path may silently drop it.

/// The whole calibration rests on one cancellation (the BeepBeep observation):
/// one microphone hears both speakers, so the Mac's capture latency and the
/// probes' shared scheduled start are common to both arrivals and drop out of
/// the DIFFERENCE. What survives is the per-speaker output latency difference
/// plus the speakers' distance asymmetry to the mic (~2.9 ms per metre).
///
/// Weighting is SNR-aware, not PHAT: when the caller supplies an ambient-noise
/// segment (a lead-in slice of the same recording, before the probes start),
/// correlation bins are divided by the measured noise power spectrum, so a
/// tonal interferer (a hum, a voice) is discounted instead of being whitened

/// needs (the 2026 TDOA-probing result: trained estimators learn
