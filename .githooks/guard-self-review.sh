# GUARD 7 helper: staged-Swift readability screen.
# Called by pre-commit; runnable standalone while iterating on it:
#   sh .githooks/guard-self-review.sh    (exit 0 = would pass)
#
# A deterministic screen over the ADDED comment lines of the staged
#   Swift diff (-U0, so only added lines count). It hard-blocks only
#   near-certain slop — the three patterns the Mac repo's 2026-08-06
#   audit found with ~zero false positives — and prints softer past-tense
#   patterns as a warning for a reader to weigh. A rare legitimate hit takes a trailing
#   `slop-ok` comment.
