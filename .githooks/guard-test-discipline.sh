# GUARD 11 helper: test discipline for staged test files.
# Called by pre-commit; runnable standalone while iterating on it:
#   sh .githooks/guard-test-discipline.sh    (exit 0 = would pass)
#
# (A @Test line added in a hunk that also removed one is a rename or an
# attribute edit of an existing test, not a new test: replacing one @Test
# with a different test in the same hunk, equal counts, is not checked.)
# Three checks over staged Swift files under Tests/:
#   1. every ADDED @Test has, in the comment block directly above it, a
#      sentence naming the change that turns it red (no escape marker)
#   2. no added print( line (trailing `print-ok` exempts)
#   3. a NEW test file holds more than one @Test (`new-suite-ok` exempts)
# Real-time waits are tools/check-test-waits.sh's job, run after this.

# A conflict-resolution merge commit (MERGE_HEAD present) carries other
# people's lines; a clean merge never runs pre-commit at all.
